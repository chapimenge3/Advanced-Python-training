    "## Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start with iterators because they are the building blocks of generators. \n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are talking about iterators, we should talk about iterables as well. An iterable is an object that can return an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now basically, when you program you might want to loop over a collection of items. For example, a list of names. You might want to loop over the list and print out each name.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Iterator was introduced in Python 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators take responsibility for two main actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Returning the data from a stream or container one item at a time\n",
    "    - Keeping track of the current and visited items\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an iterator in Python, we need to implement the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to our object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__iter__()` method acts similar to `__init__()` , you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.\n",
    "The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__next__()` method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "FYI: Python uses iterators in operations like `for` loops, `list` comprehensions, `map` and `filter` functions, etc. So, even if you don't use iterators directly, you use them indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.)."

    "\n",
    "Now we have a basic understanding of iterators, let's talk about generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python. Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function, but with a `yield` statement instead of a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function contains at least one `yield` statement (it may contain other `yield` or `return` statements), it becomes a generator function. Both `yield` and `return` will return some value from a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that, while a `return` statement terminates a function entirely, `yield` statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple generator function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_gen():\n",
    "    n = 1\n",
    "    print(\"This is printed first\")\n",
    "    yield n\n",
    "\n",
    "    n += 1\n",
    "    print(\"This is printed second\")\n",
    "    yield n\n",
    "\n",
    "    n += 1\n",
    "    print(\"This is printed at last\")\n",
    "    yield n\n",
    "\n",
    "a = my_gen()\n",
    "next(a)\n",
    "next(a)\n",
    "next(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm new thing again right ? yeah `next()` function. It is used to get the next item from the iterator. It is used in for loop internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in my_gen():\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, the for loop calls the `next()` function for iterator object `my_gen()` created and prints its value until `StopIteration` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def rev_str(my_str):\n",
    "    length = len(my_str)\n",
    "    for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):\n",
    "        yield my_str[i]\n",
    "    \n",
    "for char in rev_str(\"hello\"):\n",
    "    print(char)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generator Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator expressions are a simple way of creating generators. It is just like a list comprehension, but with parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 3, 6, 10] \n",
    "a = (x**2 for x in my_list)\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _make_gen():\n",
    "    for x in my_list:\n",
    "        yield x**2\n",
    "a = _make_gen()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairly simple right ? Let's see another example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 3, 6, 10]\n",
    "a = (x**2 for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0)\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _make_gen():\n",
    "    for x in my_list:\n",
    "        if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            yield x**2\n",
    "a = _make_gen()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generator Functions vs Generator Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a for loop. Generator expressions allow you to declare a generator inline without having to explicitly define a function or even name the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _my_gen():\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why generators are used in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are used in Python because they allow programmers to implement a kind of lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation is a strategy that delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed. This is useful when the value of an expression is needed only if some condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used Django, you might have seen this in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_queryset(self):\n",
    "    return Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now()).order_by('-published_date')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_queryset()` method is called by the `ListView` class to get the list of objects that are going to be displayed. In this case, the list of posts that are going to be displayed on the index page of the blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever heard when people says Django uses Lazy Evaluation ? This is what they are talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django uses generators to implement lazy evaluation. The `get_queryset()` method returns a generator that will be used to get the list of posts. The generator will only be evaluated when the list of posts is actually needed. This is useful because it allows Django to avoid querying the database if the list of posts is not needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why if you just `print` the `get_queryset()` method, you will not see any posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(get_queryset())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "# <generator object PostListView.get_queryset at 0x7f9b8c0b9f68>\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
