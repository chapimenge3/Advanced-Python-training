    "## Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start with iterators because they are the building blocks of generators. \n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are talking about iterators, we should talk about iterables as well. An iterable is an object that can return an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now basically, when you program you might want to loop over a collection of items. For example, a list of names. You might want to loop over the list and print out each name.\n",
    "\n",
    "First Iterator was introduced in Python 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators take responsibility for two main actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Returning the data from a stream or container one item at a time\n",
    "    - Keeping track of the current and visited items\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an iterator in Python, we need to implement the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to our object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__iter__()` method acts similar to `__init__()` , you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.\n",
    "The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself. If required, some initialization can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__next__()` method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "FYI: Python uses iterators in operations like `for` loops, `list` comprehensions, `map` and `filter` functions, etc. So, even if you don't use iterators directly, you use them indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.)."
